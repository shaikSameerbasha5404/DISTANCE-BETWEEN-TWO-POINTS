## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1:
Import math as m
### Step 2:
Take input from user.
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formu](/form.png)
### Step 4: 
Print the distance between two points.
### Step 5: 
End the program.
### PROGRAM:

import math as m
l1=[10,6]
l2=[4,2]
d=m.sqrt(((l1[0]-l2[0])**2)+((l1[1]-l2[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(d))
  ```
### OUTPUT:
